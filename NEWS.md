Release 0.5.6rc
---------------
- made signed char explicit for three usages of values

Release 0.5.5
-------------
- Fall back to DLIS when VMTF and VSIDS is off.
- Added NCDCL to run pure DPLL in satch (without non-chronological
 backjumping). It uses DLIS as decision heuristic and does not
 restart.
- NCHEAPPROFILING does more expansive profiling
- Added vivification (VIVIFICATION), with detection of implied literals
 (NVIVIFYIMPLY)
- Chronological backtracking (CHRONO). You can either reuse the trail similarly
 to restarts or always backtrack to the previous level (CHRONOREUSE)
- More advanced minimization criterion (see our SAT'21 paper)

Release 0.5.4
-------------

- possibly counters instead of watches
- bounded variable elimination and subsumption
  (as first inprocessing and preprocessing algorithms)
- learned clause shrinking (from our SAT'21 paper)
- '-f', '-l' and '-static' configure script options
- LOGLIT / logging_literal for more verbose literal logging
- removed passing solver fields as arguments (was actually slower)

Release 0.4.17
--------------

- Renamed 'stack' operations (more verbose names).
- Using queue to encode XORs to avoid quadratic worst-case.
- Reusing the trail during restarts using 'matching trail level' (MTL).

Release 0.4.7
-------------

- Almost complete colored solver messages (in 'report' etc.).
- Support for reading and encoding XNF (CNF with OR and XOR clauses).
- New makefile goals: test-two-ways, test-all-pairs, test-all-triples.
- Binary search in two-way combinatorial tester 'gencombi'.
- Code clean-up: sorted statistics fields, moved some internal code up.
- Using stable radix sort in 'reduce' allowed to remove clause ids.
- Radix sorting (to speed-up sorting of 'analyzed' stack).

Release 0.4.2
-------------

- Saving phases fixed (pointer increase by two - thanks to Mathias Fleury).
- Using assigned variables instead of trail height for target/best phases.
- Scripts have now colors (thanks to Daniel Le Berre).

Release 0.4.0
-------------

- More precise ticks management.
- Combinatorial tester `gencombi.c` uses the incremental feature for
  scalability (needs it with all those new features).
- Limited incremental mode (conflict limited but not allowing to add new
  clauses nor assumptions).
- Original, inverted (INVERTED) and best (BEST) rephasing.
- Made phase saving a feature (SAVE).
- Initial phase explicitly set to "true" (feature TRUE).
- Bumping reason side literals (REASON).
- By default using target phases in stable mode (TARGET).
- Renamed COMPACT feature to VIRTUAL (binary clause) feature.
- Three tier clause reduction scheme (including new features
  GLUE,TIER1,TIER2, and USED to control clause reduction).
- Allowing conflict limits including a `--conflicts=<limit>` solver option.
- Much more precise interaction of VMTF, VSIDS, STABLE and FOCUSED features
  (see comments in [features.h](features.h) for more details).
- Removed old combinatorial testing script `combi.sh` (now completely relying on
  `gencombi` compiled from `gencombi.c`).
- New [`features/generate.c`](features/generate.c) program to automatically
  generated sub-scripts for [`configure`](configure) and header files for
  [`features.h`](features.h) and [`gencombi.c`](gencombi.c) from feature
  lists in `features` directory (see
  [features/README.md](features/README.md) for details).
